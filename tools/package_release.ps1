PSXRecomp $Version

This package includes the MIT-licensed OpenBIOS from PCSX-Redux. Its notice is
in bios/OpenBIOS.LICENSE. It does not include a retail PlayStation BIOS, game
disc image, generated game source, save data, or copyrighted Sony/game assets.

First launch:
1. Run PSXRecomp.exe.
2. OpenBIOS runs by default. No external BIOS is required.

You can select your legally obtained SCPH1001.BIN instead. The selected path is
saved in bios.cfg next to the executable; clear it to return to OpenBIOS.

This framework package is BIOS-only. Game-specific PSXRecomp releases use the
same BIOS picker and additionally prompt for the required game disc image.

Keyboard and Xbox-style controller defaults are documented in README.md.
Controller mappings are configurable in input.ini.

Memory cards are stored in the saves directory.
