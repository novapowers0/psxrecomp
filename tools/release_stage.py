"""release_stage.py — THE release staging implementation, for every psxrecomp
title, on every platform.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
Release packaging is the same job on Windows and Linux: derive the overlay
codegen cache tag, copy the shards that carry it, copy the overlay toolchain,
copy the mod catalog, and refuse to produce a package when any of that is
missing. Until now it was implemented FIVE times:

  * tools/release_overlay_stage.ps1 in this repo (the shared Windows module,
    added by beads-eio.2.6 after a packager that re-derived the tag in
    PowerShell staged ZERO shards from a perfectly good cache), and
  * tools/package_appimage.sh forked into ApeEscapeRecomp (416 lines),
    Tomba2Recomp (436) and MegaManX6Recomp (408), each with its own copy of
    the tag derivation. (Line counts are of each repo's origin/master. Reading
    a working tree gives the wrong answer here -- the Ape checkout is parked on
    an old branch and reports 403.)

Every one of those four hand-built the tag string. Measured 2026-09-02, on each
repo's origin/master:

    repo             composes _f   calls cache_tag()   stages toolchain
    ApeEscapeRecomp       yes            no                  no
    Tomba2Recomp          NO             no                  no
    MegaManX6Recomp       NO             no                  no

The `_f<flavor>` field was added to the tag in the framework. Exactly one of the
three forks was hand-patched to append it (ApeEscapeRecomp 4a17272, 2026-08-28).
The other two still emit `cg<N>_<hash>_gc<hash>`, and their shard filter is
`find -path "*/$cg_tag/*"`, which requires a slash immediately after the tag.
The real directory is `..._f0/`, so the pattern cannot match, `shards` evaluates
to 0, and the packager exits 1. That is why Tomba 2 v0.0.9 shipped Windows-only:
there is no AppImage asset in that release at all. See bead beads-eio.3.102.

A fix that has to be applied N times gets applied fewer than N times. So the
logic lives here, once, and the platform scripts are argument marshalling:

    tools/release_overlay_stage.ps1   dot-sourced by a title's package_release.ps1
    tools/release_overlay_stage.sh    sourced by a title's package_appimage.sh

Both are THIN. Neither contains a tag format string, a shard filter, or a
catalog rule; if you are about to add one to either, add it here instead.

THE TAG COMES FROM compile_overlays.cache_tag(), FULL STOP
==========================================================
`cache_tag()` (tools/compile_overlays.py) is the single source of truth and must
stay identical to overlay_loader.c's scan_cache_dir(). This file imports it and
calls it. It does not know the tag's shape and must never learn it — the whole
defect class above is what a second copy of that format string costs. The same
applies to the arch-abi segment and the shared-library suffix: `cache_arch_abi()`
and `overlay_ext()` come from the same module rather than being re-derived.

Usage (see each subcommand's --help):
    python3 tools/release_stage.py cg-tag          ...
    python3 tools/release_stage.py stage-cache     ...

# Selection is the suffix ALLOWLIST above, so a new artifact kind appearing in a
# producer's cache is excluded by default rather than shipped by default. This
# denylist is checked FIRST anyway, for two reasons: some producer-internal
# files end in a shippable suffix (see the temp-shard note below), and the
# staged tree is re-scanned against this same list after copying, so a bug in
# the selection code fails the release instead of shipping a memo that
# suppresses the runtime's ABI preflight.
#
#   .abi_<tag>.ok   a completed-sweep memo. The runtime's ABI preflight skips
#                   re-verifying every shard when it finds this file. Shipping
#                   it tells a player's first launch that a sweep it never ran
#                   already passed, which is precisely how a stale shard gets
#                   loaded instead of rejected.
#   *.c             the generated C the shard was compiled from. Large, and it
#                   is producer input, not a runtime artifact.
#   *.pair-lock     a producer-side concurrency lock. Meaningless to a player
#                   and actively confusing if a stale one ships.
#   .<name>.so.tmp.<rand>.so   an IN-PROGRESS shard. compile_overlays writes
#                   each shard to a hidden temp name and renames it into place,
#                   so a cache directory that is being written, or was written
#                   by an interrupted run, holds files that END IN THE SHIPPABLE
#                   SUFFIX. Measured 2026-09-02 in a live Tomba 2 cache build:
#                     .00096000_407B1780.so.tmp.ryt4jqca.so

#                   A suffix allowlist alone therefore SHIPS them, and so did
#                   the old shell `find -name '*.so'`. Every producer-internal
#                   file observed in a real cache is HIDDEN, and no shippable
#                   artifact ever is, so a leading dot is the reliable
#                   discriminator and is applied before the suffix test.
